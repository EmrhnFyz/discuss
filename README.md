# Next.js Reddit-Style App Prototype 

## Introduction

Welcome to my personal project, where I dive into the world of web development with a focus on learning and mastering Next.js. This endeavor is about creating a prototype of an app inspired by Reddit, using the powerful features of Next.js. It's a solo journey of discovery and skill enhancement in the realms of modern web development.

## Key Technologies
- **Next.js:** The backbone of the project, leveraging its powerful features for server-side rendering, static site generation, and overall performance optimization.
- **Next UI:** Utilized to enhance the user interface with responsive, modern, and visually appealing components, ensuring a great user experience.
- **NextAuth:** Implemented for secure and scalable user authentication, ensuring a safe user experience.
- **GitHub OAuth:** Integrated GitHub OAuth for a streamlined and reliable sign-in process, allowing users to log in using their GitHub accounts.
- **Prisma:** Utilized Prisma as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool to simplify database operations, enhancing data management and access.
- **PostgreSQL:** Employed PostgreSQL as the database, known for its robustness and reliability, to manage and store application data efficiently.

## Project Features
In this project, I have developed various features that mirror the functionalities of Reddit, using the Next.js framework. Here's a snapshot of what I've built
- **Home Page:** The landing page of the app, designed to be welcoming and easy to navigate.
- **Sign-Up Functionality:** A simple and secure way for users to create an account and join the platform.
